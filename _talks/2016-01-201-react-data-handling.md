Have you tried building a simple React app, but been overwhelmed as soon as you needed to share data between components?

React is a Javascript UI library which is great for building out client side applications. It only provides the view layer, making it easy to get started but as your application grows in complexity you’ll likely need to adopt a more systematic way to handle data. We'll explore how this can be addressed by two different unidirectional data flow architectures, Flux and Redux, and the advantages these patterns can bring to any client side application (whether or not you’re using React).
