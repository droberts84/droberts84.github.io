Does your application frequently respond with similar results? Rails provides many caching tools which when used properly can significantly reduce your web applicationâ€™s response times.  If set up incorrectly, you risk sending stale data to your users. We'll cover the various types of caching Rails offers, including Cache Stores, Conditional GETs and Russian Doll Caching with a focus on reducing HTTP response times, along with some pain points you might encounter.  I recently applied these techniques to reduce average response times of an application from over 1 second to under 10 milliseconds.
